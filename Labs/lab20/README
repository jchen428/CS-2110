==================================================================================================================

As you start making your gameboy game, you will often get in a situation where you want to debug your games.
However, the GBA doesn't have a terminal that you can use printf to print to. We have to be a little bit more 
creative with how we debug our games. 

Two useful techniques to debug your GBA games are to light up pixels under certain conditions and to use the font 
data to draw strings to the GBA's screen. We're going to have you do both in this lab.

We have given you functions to set a pixel and draw a character/string to the GBA screen in the myLib file. For 
this lab you need to do the following in the main.c file:

1) When one of the d-pad buttons are pressed (up, down, left, right), set the pixel at location (10,10) to a certain 
    color so that we know which button is being pressed currently.
        Up = White
        Down = Red
        Left = Blue
        Right = Green
        
2) When the A or B button is pressed, draw a string to the screen saying that the button has been pressed. When
    the buttons haven't been pressed, no strings should be drawn to the screen. 


You can run your game with "make vba". When you're done, run "make clean" and compress all your files into 
lab20.tar.gz (or lab20.zip) and submit it to t-square.
