Put your answers in this file and submit it under the T-Square assignment.


Problem 1
---------
A) The BILL 9000 computer has 16 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.

The addressability of this memory is...
8 bits


The address space of this memory is...
2^16 = 65536 locations


B) The NOOB 2110 computer (also sold as the ANDREW 2110 computer in some markets)
has 7 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.However memory addresses 0x00 - 0x1F
are not able to be written to or read from.

The addressability of this memory is...
8 bits


The address space of this memory is...
2^7 - 2^5 = 96 locations


(Some things to think about)
- What is the addressability of your laptop computer?
- What is the address space of your laptop computer?


Problem 2
---------

What is the difference between combinational and sequential logic?
Sequential logic stores information and changes its output based on the information stored.
Combinatorial logic does not store information and always produces the same output given the same inputs.


Complete the following table by marking an "x" where applicable.

|========================================|
| Component | Combinational | Sequential |
|========================================|
| ALU       |       X       |            |
| AND GATE  |       x       |            |
| REGISTER  |               |      X     |
| MEMORY    |               |      X     |
| DECODER   |       X       |            |
| RS LATCH  |               |      X     |
=========================================|


Problem 3
---------
Make a 2-bit addressable memory that has a address space of 8. (i.e. there are 8 addresses each holding 2 bits)
You do not need to turn this circuit in, but it is highly recommend that you actually make it.


How many bits are there for the output of your memory?
2 bits


How many bits are there for the address input of the memory?
3 bits



Make sure to ask the TA's if you have any questions!
